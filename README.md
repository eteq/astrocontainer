# astrocontainer

This is a cookiecutter template to easily create project-based containers for astronomy-related work (with a focus on a Python-based software stack).

To use this template, you must have [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) installed.  Then do::

  % cookiecutter astrcontainer

And follow the prompts. Once this is done, go into the generated directory, update the `requirements.txt` with project-specific requirements, and then follow the instructions in the project directory README.
